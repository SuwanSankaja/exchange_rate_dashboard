   cd exchange_rate_dashboard
   ```

2. **Create the Environment File:**

   ```

4. **Access the Application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is designed for easy deployment on any VPS (like a DigitalOcean Droplet) using Docker. The high-level steps involve:

1. Provisioning a server with the Docker Marketplace image.

2. Cloning the repository and setting up the `.env` file.

3. Configuring the UFW firewall to allow SSH and Nginx traffic.

4. Running the application stack with `docker compose up --build -d`.

5. Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic to the application.

6. Securing the domain with a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.

## üì° API Endpoint

The backend exposes a dynamic API endpoint to retrieve data for the dashboard.

* `GET /api/rates/:currency`

  * **Description:** Fetches all historical rate data for a given currency.

  * **URL Params:** `:currency` can be `aud`, `usd`, `eur`, or `gbp`.

  * **Example:** A request to `GET /api/rates/usd` will fetch all documents from the `daily_usd_rates` collection in MongoDB.
